# Genetic diversity in Mexican Gray Wolves Simulation

In this simulation, wolves will have 6 alleles that can have values ranging from 1 - 5 that represent the relevant genetics of the wolf. These values are taken to match the statistics analyzed in the study "Genetic Variability in Six Mexican Gray Wolf (Canis lupusbuileyi) Populations Determined by Microsatellite Markers" [1]
